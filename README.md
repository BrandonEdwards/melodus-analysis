## chick-weight-analysis.R
This script analyzes the daily weights of the chicks in *melodus*. It outputs a plot of the daily chick weights with the grand mean overlayed. Also overlayed is the expected growth rate from both a fitted Gompertz equation and a fitted Logistic equation (Martens and Goossen 2008).
