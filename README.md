# melodus-analysis

Analysis scripts written in R to analyze the output from the *melodus* model as seen [here](https://github.com/BrandonEdwards/melodus). This repository contains the following scripts:

## chick-weight-analysis.R
This script analyzes the daily weights of the chicks in *melodus*. It will output two plots:
1. **Mean Simulated Chick Weights vs. Expected Chick Weights** - Plot the time series means for each simulation and plot the expected growth rate line.
2. **Great Mean Simulated Chick Weights vs. Expected Chick Weights** - Plot the mean of all simulations against the expected growth rate. Also plots standard deviation ribbon.
